# Logistic-Regression-Project

# Introduction
This project predict whether it will rain in australia based on historical weather data using logisitc regression

# Dataset Context
This Dataset sourced from kaggle contain about 10 years of daily weather observations for numerous australian weather stations.

Rain tomorrow is the variable to predict. Meaning did it rain the next day - Yes or No?


# CONCLUSION:

This project provides valuable insight into prediction Rainfall for the following historical weather data.

The logistic regression model with an accuracy of 83.16%, shows potential in making reasonable decisions.

However, further analysis would be required, including exploring additional features and investigating the reasons behind false positive and false negative.

By addressing these aspects the model reliability can be improve making it more suitable for real world application
